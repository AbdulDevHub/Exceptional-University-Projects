=== Module Description ===
This module contains four functions for you to implement, where each
operates on either a stack or a queue.

We've deliberately provided confusing implementations of these ADTs in
adts.py (download this file from the prep handout). This is because we
don't want you to care at all about the implementations of these classes,
but instead ONLY use the public methods defined in by the Stack or Queue ADTs.
(Refer to the readings if you aren't sure what these are.)

In particular, this means that you shouldn't try to access any attributes
of either class, since the ADT descriptions only define what *operations*
(methods) can be used for the ADTs.

GENERAL HINT: save values in local variables! Even if you pop an item off of
a stack, it's not "gone forever" if you assign it to a variable.

from adts import Stack, Queue


def peek(stack: Stack) -> Optional[Any]:
    """Return the top item on the given stack.

    If the stack is empty, return None.

    Unlike Stack.pop, this function should leave the stack unchanged when the
    function ends. You can (and should) still call pop and push, just make
    sure that if you take any items off the stack, you put them back on!
