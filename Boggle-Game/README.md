## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Boggle game implemented in Java. The game involves finding words in a grid of letters that are randomly placed.

## Game Instructions

1. The Boggle board contains a grid of letters that are randomly placed.
2. Players try to find words in this grid by joining the letters.
3. A word can be formed by connecting adjoining letters on the grid. Two letters adjoin if they are next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. The words you find must be at least 4 letters long, and you can't use a letter twice in any single word.
5. Points are based on word length: a 4-letter word is worth 1 point, 5-letter words earn 2 points, and so on.
6. After you find as many words as you can, the game will find all the remaining words.
